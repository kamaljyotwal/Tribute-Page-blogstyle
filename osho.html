          During his lifetime he was viewed as a controversial new religious
          movement leader and mystic. In the 1960s he travelled throughout India
          as a public speaker and was a vocal critic of socialism, arguing that
          India was not ready for socialism and that socialism, communism, and
          anarchism could evolve only when capitalism had reached its maturity.
          Rajneesh also criticised Mahatma Gandhi,and the orthodoxy of
          mainstream religions.Rajneesh emphasised the importance of meditation,
          mindfulness, love, celebration, courage, creativity, and
          humour—qualities that he viewed as being suppressed by adherence to
          static belief systems, religious tradition, and socialisation. In
          advocating a more open attitude to human sexuality he caused
          controversy in India during the late 1960s and became known as "the
          sex guru".

          <h4>Ego and the Mind</h4>
          <p>
            According to Rajneesh every human being is a Buddha with the
            capacity for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of
            responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually
            prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating
            false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that is
            nothing but a barrier of dreams. Otherwise man's innate being can
            flower in a move from the periphery to the centre. Rajneesh viewed
            the mind first and foremost as a mechanism for survival, replicating
            behavioural strategies that have proven successful in the past. But
            the mind's appeal to the past, he said, deprives human beings of the
            ability to live authentically in the present, causing them to
            repress genuine emotions and to shut themselves off from joyful
            experiences that arise naturally when embracing the present moment:
            "The mind has no inherent capacity for joy. ... It only thinks about
            joy." The result is that people poison themselves with all manner of
            neuroses, jealousies, and insecurities.He argued that psychological
            repression, often advocated by religious leaders, makes suppressed
            feelings re-emerge in another guise, and that sexual repression
            resulted in societies obsessed with sex. Instead of suppressing,
            people should trust and accept themselves unconditionally.This
            should not merely be understood intellectually, as the mind could
            only assimilate it as one more piece of information: instead
            meditation was needed.

          <h3>Meditation</h3>
          <p>
            Rajneesh presented meditation not just as a practice but as a state
            of ach are less animated, although they also include physical
            activity of one sort or another.His later "meditative therapies"
            require sessions for several days, OSHO Mystic Rose comprising three
            hours of laughing every day for a week, three hours of weeping each
            day for a second week, and a third week with three hours of silent
            meditation. These processes of "witnessing" enable a "jump into
            awareness".Rajneesh believed such cathartic methods were necessary
            because it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter
            meditation. once these methods had provided a glimpse of meditation,
            then people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.
